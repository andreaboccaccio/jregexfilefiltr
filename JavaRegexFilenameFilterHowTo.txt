JavaRegexFilenameFilterHowTo.txt

Hi everyone, JavaRegexFilenameFilter, former regexfilenamefilter, before I move
to Sourceforge, is a very simple java library to build objects that implements
the "FilenameFilter" java interface.

It is very, very simple to use, you have to add the library jar in your
java application classpath, then you have to call:
"RegexFilenameFilterFactory.getInstance().buildRegexFilenameFilter(<place here
your regex>)"
this method call returns an object that implements the java interface
"FilenameFilter" that you can pass as a parameter to File method "listFiles" to
get a list of filenames that match the regex you pass as parameter to the
buildRegexFilenameFilter above.
If you want to see an exemple there is the unit test in "RegexFilenameFilterTest"
class code.

I hope this is usefull and you enjoy it.
